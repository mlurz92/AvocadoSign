**Study Aim**
To evaluate the diagnostic performance of a novel contrast-enhancement-based MRI marker, termed the "Avocado Sign," by comparing it against both literature-based and computationally optimized T2-weighted criteria for predicting patient-level mesorectal lymph node involvement in rectal cancer.

**Methods**
*   **Study Design:** Secondary analysis of a retrospective, single-institution cohort.
*   **The Avocado Sign:** Defined as a **hypointense core within an otherwise homogeneously hyperintense lymph node** on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted fat-saturated images.
*   **Patient Population:** 106 patients with confirmed rectal cancer. The cohort was split into two subgroups for analysis:
    *   **Surgery Alone Subgroup (n=27):** Treatment-naïve patients.
    *   **Neoadjuvant Subgroup (n=79):** Patients who received standard neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy.
*   **Image Analysis:** Two blinded radiologists independently assessed all visible mesorectal lymph nodes for the presence of the Avocado Sign and for standard T2-weighted morphologic features. Patient-level nodal status was deemed positive if at least one node fulfilled the respective criteria.
*   **Reference Standard:** Histopathological examination of resected specimens.
*   **Statistical Analysis:** The diagnostic performance of the Avocado Sign was compared against T2-based criteria using the DeLong test for the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).

**Key Results (beyond Abstract)**
*   **Overall Diagnostic Performance (n=106):**
    *   The Avocado Sign demonstrated superior diagnostic accuracy across the entire cohort.
    *   **Sensitivity:** 95.8%
    *   **Specificity:** 86.2%
    *   **PPV:** 85.2%
    *   **NPV:** 96.2%
    *   **Accuracy:** 90.6%
    *   The **AUC was .91**, which was statistically superior to an optimized T2-based benchmark (AUC, .82; *P* = .02) and to the standard ESGAR criteria (AUC, .71; *P* < .001).

*   **Subgroup Performance:**
    *   **Surgery Alone Subgroup:** The sign achieved an AUC of .92, which was not significantly different from the optimized T2 benchmark for this subgroup (*P* = .96).
    *   **Neoadjuvant Subgroup:** The sign achieved an AUC of .90, significantly outperforming the optimized T2 benchmark for this subgroup (AUC, .78; *P* = .01).

*   **Interobserver Agreement:**
    *   The agreement between the two radiologists in identifying the Avocado Sign was **almost perfect (Cohen's kappa = 0.92)**.

**Conclusion**
The Avocado Sign is a highly accurate and reproducible imaging marker for mesorectal lymph node staging in rectal cancer. Its performance is superior to both established and computationally optimized T2-weighted criteria, particularly in the challenging post-neoadjuvant setting. The integration of contrast-enhanced sequences for assessing the Avocado Sign has the potential to simplify and improve the accuracy of nodal staging, thereby refining clinical decision-making.
